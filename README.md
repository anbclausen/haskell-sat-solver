# Really slow and naive SAT solver implemented in Haskell
This is a personal project trying to learn Haskell. :)

## How to
Compile the Haskell code to run the solver.

To run (after compilation), you specify the path of the file with the problem you want to solve. It has to be in CNF DIMACS format, as the test example is.

```./sat tests/php0.sat```
