# Really slow and naive SAT solver implemented in Haskell
This is a personal project trying to learn Haskell. :)

## How to
You can either compile the Haskell code yourself, or you can run the executable in your Linux terminal.

To run, you specify the path of the file with the problem you want to solve. It has to be in CNF DIMACS format, as the test example is.

```./sat tests/php0.sat```
